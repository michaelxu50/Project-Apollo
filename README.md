# Apollo App
Apollo is a next-generation virtual assistant.

## Running
### Option 1: Downloading the latest release
We occasionally upload releases to GitHub. These are precompiled binaries that you can run directly. You can find them [here](https://github.com/AwesomestCode/FutureHacksProject/releases)

### Option 2: Compile via Maven
*This assumes you have Maven and java installed. Please install them if you haven't already.*

Run these commands:
```bash
$ cd path/to/this/directory
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/FutureHacksProject-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
